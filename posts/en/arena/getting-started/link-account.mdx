This is a brief guide to making a solved.ac account and registering for an Arena contest.

The Arena contests are held on the [*Baekjoon Online Judge*](https://www.acmicpc.net/)(BOJ) platform. Please kindly note that:

- The BOJ is mainly a problem archive like Kattis, and is a host to many community contests mainly in the Republic of Korea. The solved.ac Arena contests are held on the BOJ platform, but the BOJ is not the Arena itself.
- Though the translation of the BOJ is still work in place, the interface related to solving problems are fully available in English. The Arena problem statements will be in English if the contest notice states so.

## Registering to the Contest Platform

First, we will make a BOJ account if you do not have one. Navigate to the [**BOJ registration page**](https://www.acmicpc.net/register) and refer to the image below to fill out the form.

The bottom section contains forms: from top to bottom, there are input boxes for handle, bio, password, password confirmation, affiliation, email, a captcha, and a checkbox that asks for receiving emails. The top section contains following information: "If you already have an account, please sign in. By signing up, you agree to Baekjoon Online Judge's terms of use, and privacy policy. If you do not want your handle to be searchable in Google search, please use a handle that is not used elsewhere. You can change your handle’s search exposure settings after signing up. Handle cannot be changed after registration."](/getting-started/register-en.png)
