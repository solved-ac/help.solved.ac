This is a brief guide to making a solved.ac account and registering for an Arena contest.

The Arena contests are held on the [*Baekjoon Online Judge*](https://www.acmicpc.net/)(BOJ) platform. Please kindly note that:

- The BOJ is mainly a problem archive like Kattis, and is a host to many community contests mainly in the Republic of Korea. The solved.ac Arena contests are held on the BOJ platform, but the BOJ is not the Arena itself.
- Though the translation of the BOJ is still work in place, the Arena problem statements and the interface related to solving problems are fully available in English.

## Registering to the Contest Platform

First, we will make a BOJ account if you do not have one. Navigate to the [**BOJ registration page**](https://www.acmicpc.net/register) and refer to the image below to fill out the form.

The top section contains following information: "If you already have an account, please sign in. By signing up, you agree to Baekjoon Online Judge's terms of use, and privacy policy.
