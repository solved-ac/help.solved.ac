## Decorations

If you meet certain conditions, decorations will be added to the acquired Class.

|                                | Decoration |                 Condition                 |
| :----------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|      <ClassIcon c={1} />       |    None    |             Acquire Class
| <ClassIcon c={1} d="silver" /> |  Silver    | Solve all Essential problems in the Class
|  <ClassIcon c={1} d="gold" />  |    Gold    |    Solve all problems in the Class

When you acquire a decoration, the Class will be displayed as $x$⁺(Silver) or $x$⁺⁺(Gold) instead of $x$ on ranking pages and some other pages. There are no bonus ratings.

## Essential Problems

Among the problems in the Class, problems considered important are called **Essential Problems**. When you solve all Essential Problems, a decoration will be added.
