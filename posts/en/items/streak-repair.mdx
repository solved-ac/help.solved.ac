**Streak Repair** is an item that can be used to restore a streak for a previous date when the streak was broken.

Streak Repair cannot be obtained through regular means, and is only granted by the administration in the following situations:

- When there was a server outage on BOJ that made it inaccessible for more than an hour on a certain date
- When there was a grading delay on BOJ that lasted more than an hour on a certain date
- Other situations where, due to solved.ac and BOJ server issues, the solved.ac administration deems it necessary to provide Streak Repair

Streak Repair can be found in the [Inventory](https://solved.ac/inventory). You can restore your streak for the specified date by clicking on the item and pressing the 'Use/Equip' button.
